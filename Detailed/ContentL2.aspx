<h2> APPLE'S HEALTH PLATFORM : RESEARCH KIT</h2>
    <p>
	Apple's new iPhone platform could enable doctors to dramatically increase the amount of health data they can gather on patients, 
        the company says.</p>
<p>
	The company revealed the platform, called <strong>ResearchKit</strong>, at a talk at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. ResearchKit 
    allows doctors to develop their own apps to gather data on people's health conditions, from asthma to Parkinson's disease. The new system 
    also makes it easy for medical researchers to enroll patients in clinical trials, a typically expensive and slow process.</p>
<p>
	So far, doctors have developed apps on this platform to study <strong>Parkinson's disease, blood sugar variability, asthma triggers, 
    breast cancer recovery and cardiovascular health.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dr. Michael McConnell,</strong> a cardiovascular medicine professor at Stanford University School of Medicine helped design an app called MyHeart Counts, which measures people&#39;s heart health using the ResearchKit.
</p>
<p>
	The system also gives patients the ability to see their own data, which usually isn&#39;t possible with traditional medical trials, Apple said in its presentation.</p>

	<strong><a>Limited data</a>-</strong>
Almost all of the medical knowledge that researchers have, comes from clinical trials, in which doctors systematically study the 
    effects of medicine, activities and lifestyle factors on human health. But, running such trials is an expensive, slow and difficult process,
     McConnell said.
"You have to recruit a large number of people, and to have a broad, representative population in a clinical trial is challenging," 
    McConnell told Live Science.
Another problem is that doctors often use a limited amount of data to analyze risk factors or diagnose disease. For instance, 
    <strong>in cardiovascular health, researchers rely on people's self-reports of how much they exercise, a notoriously inaccurate measure.</strong>

And doctors may do just one test evaluating a person's gait on a scale of 0 to 4, when diagnosing Parkinson's disease, said <strong>Apple Senior
     Vice President of Operations Jeff Williams.</strong>
</p>
    <br/>
<p><strong><a>Tons of data</a>-</strong>

By contrast, new iphone apps can gather and analyze a wealth of data, and provide it to users in real time. For instance, 
    <strong>a Parkinson's app called mPower allows patients with Parkinson's to track things like vocal tremors, hand tremors and gait problems
     using a phone's built-in microphone, accelerometers and gyroscopes.
Another app, called GlucoSuccess, tracks data such as food intake, medication and physical activity to see how all those factors affect blood 
    sugar levels in those with diabetes. And MyHeart Counts will track how people's activity levels </strong>throughout the day correlate to their 
    heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The app will also test different coaching interventions
     to see whether certain methods are better at getting people up, moving and living healthier lifestyles.
</p>
    <br/>
<p>
<strong><a>Circle of trust</a>-</strong>

All of the data is anonymized and sent to a secure server.<strong> Apple never sees the information</strong>, the company says. In addition, users can opt to
     allow their data to be used in just one clinical trial, or to also allow future researchers to have access to the data, raising the 
    possibility that trials looking at other medical questions down the line could use the same data.

Right now, the system relies on users to manually input much of their data, such as their cholesterol levels, rather than gathering it 
    directly from testing labs or medical records.

"At this stage, we are trusting a broad range of users to input their data, so it will be more and more real-world data, but it will 
    be noisier data,"-McConnell.

However,<strong> ResearchKit is integrated with Apple's HealthKit platform</strong>, which allows programmers to make apps that share data with Apple's 
    Health app and with other apps systematically. And the fact that ResearchKit open source means that as technology improves, future
     iterations of apps could integrate measurements such as blood tests and blood pressure.
