<h2>AI: Identify objects in photos and videos at near-human levels</h2>

<p>
    <strong>A new AI software program developed by researchers at Google and Stanford University can recognise objects in photos and videos at near-human levels 
    of understanding.</strong>
</p>

<p> <strong><a>The Research Work</a> - </strong>
	It was only recently that computer systems became smart enough to identify unknown objects in photographs. Even then, it has generally been 
    limited to individual objects. Now, two separate teams of researchers at Google and Stanford University have created software able to describe 
    entire scenes. This could lead to much better and more intelligent algorithms in the future.<br/>
    Stanford's work, entitled <strong>"Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions"</strong>, explains how specific details found
    in photographs and videos can be translated into written text. Google's version of the technology, in a study titled <strong>"Show and Tell: A Neural 
    Image Caption Generator"</strong>, produced similar results.<br/>
    While each team used a slightly different approach, they both combined deep convolutional neural networks with recurrent neural networks 
    that excel at text analysis and natural language processing. <strong>The programs were able to "learn" from each new interaction, with algorithms 
    enabling the system to improve its accuracy by scanning scene after scene, looking for patterns, and then using the accumulation of previously 
    described scenes to extrapolate what is being depicted in the next unknown image.</strong><br/>
    These latest algorithms are being trained on a visual dictionary <strong>"the ImageNet project" with a database of more than 14 million objects. Each 
    object is described by a mathematical term, or vector, that enables the machine to recognise the shape the next time it is encountered.</strong> Those 
    mathematical definitions are linked to the words humans would use to describe the objects.<br/>
</p>
<p> <strong><a>What the Researchers Say</a> - </strong>
    "The system can analyse an unknown image and explain it in words and phrases that make sense. This is an important milestone. It's the first time 
    we've had a computer vision system that could tell a basic story about an unknown image by identifying discrete objects and also putting them into 
    some context", says <strong>Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science and 
    director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.</strong><br/>
    "I was amazed that even with the small amount of training data that we were able to do so well. The field is just starting, and we will see a lot 
    of increases", said <strong>Oriol Vinyals, a Google computer 
    scientist who worked with members of the Google Brain project.</strong><br/>
</p>
    
<p> <strong><a>Future Prospects</a> - </strong>
    In the near term, computer vision systems that can discern the story in a picture will enable people to search photo or video archives and find 
    highly specific images. Eventually, these advances will lead to robotic systems able to navigate unknown situations. Driverless cars would also 
    be made safer. However, it also raises the prospect of even greater levels of government surveillance.</br>
