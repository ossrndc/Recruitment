<h2>Intel's Core M CPUs</h2>

<p>
<strong>At IFA 2014, Intel gave us the full skinny fifth-generation Broadwell-based Intel Core M CPUs.</strong> The chips would be thinner, and more 
        energy-efficient than past CPUs, while also offering solid performance. They would pave the way for slimmer, lighter devices than anything we have 
        ever seen before.</p>

<p><strong><a>What the Core M is supposed to do</a> - </strong>
    The most efficient chips from about four years ago need 18.5 watts to operate. Similar chips from last year require 11.5 watts of power. Core M 
    cuts that number down drastically, asking for a mere <strong>4.5 watts</strong> of juice.
    However, there's more to Core M than increased efficiency, and (presumably) better battery life for whatever devices it's in. Core M chips are 
    also, as we mentioned, much smaller than their older siblings.
    Core M hardware measures <strong>30 x 16.5 x 1.05 millimeters thick</strong>, while fourth-generation Intel hardware measures 40 x 24 x 1.5 millimeters.
    That s a significant reduction.</p>

<p>
    So, it's simple math. Smaller hardware means more space in system cases for PC makers to work with. This, in turn, leads to slimmer, and lighter 
    devices, like in the case of the Yoga 3 Pro.
    Also, because Core M sips on energy, it can operate while fan-less. This allows computer manufacturers to omit components from their systems that 
    are associated with keeping internals cool, including fans, heat-sinks, and air vents.</p>

<p><strong><a>Sizing up Core M chip</a> - </strong>
    Keep in mind that Core M consists of a family of chips, not just one part. <strong>The 5Y70, is the second most powerful Core M chip that Intel is 
    launching as part of this wave of silicon. The Intel Core M-5Y70 is a dual-core chip clocked at 1.1GHz, with a Turbo Boost clock of 2.6GHz.</strong>
    Not only is this the fastest Core M chip that's out now, it will only be 100MHz slower than the highest-end Core M chip that Intel is launching this 
    year. The next chip up on the totem pole is <strong>the 5Y71. That CPU runs at 1.2GHz, sports a Turbo Boost clock of 2.9GHz, and is also a dual-core chip.
    </strong></p>

<p><strong><a>Better than it seems</a> - </strong>
<p>The benchmark tests of Intel Core M looks like a disappointment. It's not as quick as previous Intel 4th-generation processors, and it doesn't always lead to 
    outstanding battery life.</p>
<p>Closer inspection, however, reveals there's actually significant improvement here. Consider the multi-core GeekBench score of 4,267. That's 
    several hundred less than the an ultrabook with an Intel Core i5-4200U, but that 4th-generation processor has a quoted Thermal Design Power (TDP) 
    of 15 watts. The  Core M-5Y70 has a quoted TDP of 4.5 watts. On paper that means the Core M manages almost equivalent performance on a third of 
    the power. In reality TDP does not translate to actual power draw (it s a guideline for laptop manufacturers, not a benchmark), but in any case it's 
    clear the Core M consumes far less juice. And remember, this early look at Core M and Broadwell is just the first slice of the pie.</p>
